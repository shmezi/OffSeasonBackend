Concrete teams vs org teams:
  Outline problem:
    I. Having a single database for all teams would mean anyone could claim any number without owning it.
      a. For example, team flood#932 could claim that it's flood#23 without any verification.
    II. Different countries include different numberings, so there would be overlap of the numbers
      a. Team Ranger in Israel has the numbers 973 however in the US 973 is potato pirates.
  Outline solution:
    I. Concrete teams - An independent team system that has no relation to a number.
      a. Concrete teams can be assigned org teams.
    II. Org teams - The team authorized and managed by an organization running an event.
      b. This team number can be assigned to a concrete team. It can not be used on other orgs
